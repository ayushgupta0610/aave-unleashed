A valid liquidationCall must fulfil the following criteria:

* Status flags for both collateral and borrow asset must be ACTIVE and NOT PAUSED
* L2 check
* Ensure user's health factor < 1
* Collateral check
  * check that liquidation threshold is non-zero
  * confirm that user is using the collateral: `isUsingAsCollateral`

Since the liquidator can claim a single collateral of choice - we need to check the collateral address passed to ensure that it is indeed a valid selection. Else we might liquidate an asset that was not marked as collateral.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Liquidation threshold**&#x20;

* is the percentage at which a loan is defined as under-collateralized.
* usually no more than 10-15% above LTV.

For example, a liquidation threshold of 80% means that if the loan value rises above 80% of the collateral, the loan could be liquidated.

If the loan reaches the liquidation threshold, Aave prevents a user from borrowing and the user must either partially close their position or provide more collateral.
